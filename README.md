# Binary Tree

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of binary
trees, including their basic operations and implementations in various
use cases. Binary trees are an essential data structure in computer
science, used for storing and organizing data in a hierarchical manner.

One of the most fundamental properties of a binary tree is that each
node can have at most two children, known as the left child and the
right child.


## What is a Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a data structure primarily used for storing data.
It has a unique property where each node can have at most two
children. This property combines the advantages of both a sorted
array, allowing for fast search operations, and a linked list,
enabling fast insertion and deletion operations.

## Binary Search Tree Representation

A binary search tree follows a specific rule where the value of a node's
left child must be less than the value of its parent, and the value of
the node's right child must be greater than the value of its parent.
